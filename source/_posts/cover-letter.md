# Cover Letter

Dear Associate Professor Carsten Roever,

I'm Rena (Wei Gao), a current student in the Master of Applied Linguistics at the University of Melbourne. I've developed my keen interests in L2 pragmatics, so I hope to pursue further study in this area. I have conducted a research project as master thesis to measure the listener responses and interactional competence of study abroad Chinese L1 speakers in Australian universities. During my undergraduate study (2019), I published a Chinese paper on investing English L2 learning motivation in Chinese universities among non-English majors.

Please allow me to introduce my PhD topic briefly, and I believe my proposed topic matches with your research area. After doing a preliminary study, I noticed that improving interactional competence in language expression is essential in developing pragmatics ability for study abroad students. In my research, I would mainly focus on the development of interactional practices (e.g., email in an academic setting; the expression on social media, chat with native speakers and etc.) during study abroad and applying a cross-linguistics approach to analyze the impact of L1 when developing L2 competence. Chinese L1 students in Australian universities would be the main population of this study. Also, I would apply discourse analysis to provide both qualitative and quantitative empirical data in this research.

I've learned that you have published widely in these research areas, especially in areas related to L2 pragmatics and interactional competence. I believe my proposed topic is suitable for you to supervise. I wonder in the next available intake (2022), do you have a plan to recruit new PhD students, and will I have the honor to work with you under your supervision? For your further consideration, I attached my CV, 2500-words Research proposal and response to attributes.

Thank you for your time reading this email and I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards, Wei Gao
