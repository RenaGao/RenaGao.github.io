## Introduction of the interview report:

This report investigates the impact of the COVID-19 on international students who are resident in Melbourne and how it changed their studying, social interactions and future working plan. All four interviewees are master students from the School of Languages and Linguistics. The interview adopts a semi-structured method to see their encountered challenges and attitude towards online learning and their social life as well as their future work choice in the year 2020.

The motivation for drafting this report is that all group members are international students who suffered a lot due to COVID-19. Thus we intended to provide useful information for other international students in Melbourne. During the process of completing this assignment, four members in our group cooperated well although we depend on online communication software to update each other. Before conducting the interview, I settled the topic and focus of this interview, then all the group members brainstormed on the interview questions collaboratively. Then, each of us is responsible for one part of the report and contacted our interviewees respectively.

During the process of each interview, four group members would all be in the Zoom session, and when completing the interview, all members would listen to the recording again and find some interesting points to address in the report. Finally, after drafting the report, we improved the ability of collaborative work, especially in writing and conducting the interview.

## Reflection of the interview report:

- Identify the interview focus is essential

Before conducting this assignment, I have interview experience when I was Research Assistant in the Australian Center. But I mainly help to collect and analyse discourse data instead of design an interview individually by myself. When first dived into this report, I began to wonder what is worth interviewing for international students in Australian university since I hold such an identity myself. After a reflection on my own experience in the past year, I think to interest the impact of the pandemic on international students would be interesting and meaningful. Thus, I decided to set the topic as:

<p class="note note-info">How COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Studying Abroad in Australian University: A Case of Master Students in School of Language and Linguistics</p>

- Make everyone clear about their role


To be honest, this is the most challenging part for me since the other three group members donâ€™t have any interview experience, so making all members understand their role in the first place is quite difficult. So, I use several meetings to show them the difference between an interview and conversations and how to analyse interview data from an objective perspective. Besides, we employ Google Doc to demonstrate everyone's progress in the interview so that the whole group could be much clearer about this program. Although four group members mainly worked online due to the post-pandemic reason, the weekly meeting went on pretty well. 

- Time management is everything

When the group is working on the interview report, there are other assignments due at the same time. Thus, it is essential to allocate the duty in a reasonable schedule. After everyone finalized their part, I look through the whole interview report and correct some typos and grammar mistakes. Through this assignment, I learned the skills of collaborative writing and interview design, especially the processes of designing interview questions.
