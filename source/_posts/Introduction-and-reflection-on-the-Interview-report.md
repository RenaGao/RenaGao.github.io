## Introduction of the interview report:

This report investigates the impact of the COVID-19 on international students who are resident in Melbourne and how it changed their style of studying, social interaction and future work plan. All four interviewees are Master students from the School of Language and Linguistics. The interview adopts the semi-structured way to see their change and attitude towards the online learning and their social life as well as their future work choice in year 2020.

During the process of completing this assignment, four members in our group collaborative well although we basically depend on online communicate software to update on each other. Before we actually conducting the interview, I settled the topic and focus of this interview, then all the group members brainstormed on the interview questions collaboratively. Then, each of us is responsible for one part in the report and contacted our interviewees respectively.
During the process of each interview, four group members would all be in the Zoom session and after completing the interview, all members would listen to the recording again and find some interesting points to address in the report. Finally, after drafting the report, we improved the ability of collaborative work, especially in writing and conducting interview.

## Reflection of the interview report:

- Identify the interview focus is essential

Before conducting this assignment, I have interview experience when I was the Research Assistant in the Australian Center. But I mainly help to collect data and analyse discourse data instead of design an interview individually by myself. When first dived into this report, I began to wonder what is worth interviewing for international students in Australian university since I hold such an identity myself. After a reflection on my own experience in the past year, I think to interest the impact of the pandemic on international students would be interesting and meaningful. Thus, I decided to set the topic as:

> **_NOTE:_** How COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Studying Abroad in Australian University: A Case of Master Students in School of Language and Linguistics

- Make everyone clear about their role
To be honest, this is the most challenging part for me since the other three group members don’t have any interview or analysis experience, so it makes all members understanding their role in the first place is quite difficult. So, I use several times to show them the difference between interview and conversation and how to analyse interview discourse from an objective perspective. Besides, we also marked everyone’s part in a Google Doc so that the whole group could be much clearer about the whole process and progress of the report. Even four group members mainly worked remotely due to the post-pandemic reason, but the weekly meeting went go pretty smooth.

- Time management is everything
When the group are working on the interview and the report, there are other assignments due at the same time, and after everyone finalized their part, I would look through all the report and correct some typos and grammar mistakes. Thus, it is essential to allocate the duty in a reasonable schedule. Through this assignment, I learned how to collaborate writing and interview others professionally, including all the processes from designing interview questions to finally doing the transcript.
