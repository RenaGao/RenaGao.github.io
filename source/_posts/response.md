# Response to Graduate Attributes: PhD Supervision
## 1. Academic skills
### 1.1. Ability in academic writing
After successfully completing a bachelor’s degree in English Language and Linguistics at Xi’an International Studies University, and as a current master student in Applied Linguistics at the University of Melbourne, I have been trained to individually conduct academic writing and critical reading. I have
high score in honour thesis (86/100) and have successfully published an academic paper on a linguistic journal in 2019.
### 1.2 Relevant prior research and/or professional experience
As an Applied Linguistics major, I have experience in being a teaching assistant (TA) in university subjects and have tutored two subjects in VCE (English Language and Chinese Second Language) in the year 2021. Besides these teaching experience, I have considerable research experience in the field of pragmatics and discourse analysis. For example, the topic of my honour thesis is about analysing the impact of English Debate in English classroom in Chinese university with the methodology of discourse analysis and quantitative statistics.
### 1.3 Understanding of the research question to be explored
In my proposed PhD topic, I clearly address six research questions around pragmatics competence and interactional competence. All six research questions are related to the measurement of interactional competence and are all closed related to the theoretical framework in assessing second language pragmatics.
### 1.4 Prior academic performance and, if relevant, professional qualifications
I have published an academic paper related to learning motivations for Chinese ESL learners on Oversea English Journal during my bachelor’s degree. And I have considerable experience as a research assistant in the Australian Research Canter in linguistics and cross-cultural study. During my bachelor’s degree study and master’s degree, my WAM is all H1(85.8 for undergraduate study and 83 for master’s degree
in current progress). I have proposed a project in measuring interactional competence as the thesis in master’s degree in 2021, which is directly links to my future PhD topic, I believe this can solid my research foundations in academic preparation for PhD study.
## 2. Preictally Grounded
### 2.1 Motivation and capacity to complete the course in a timely manner
The reason why I want to apply for PhD study is that I hold passion in second language pragmatics since it is related to how to use language resources in daily communication, which I believe is essential to explore as a linguistics major and a multi-language speaker myself. Overall, during my past study experience in both undergraduate and graduate study, finishing tasks with proper time management skills is important, especially when I was conducting my honour thesis project within a year independently, I improved a lot in planning and adjusting myself in finishing a huge research project.
### 2.2 Competitiveness for scholarship allocation; and the ability of the Faculty to provide the appropriate supervision, facilities and resources for your intended project
My average WAM and past research performance are capable in applying scholarship; as for my proposed topic, in school of language and linguistics there are several supervisors who are available to supervise the research in language testing and second language pragmatics (e.g., Carsten Roever; Jason Fan, Ute Knoch). Moreover, within the Language Testing Centre, there is huge potential in promoting pragmatics assessment in large scale language tests which directly matches with my topic.
### 2.3 Have obtained the endorsement of a prospective supervisor
Yes, Carsten Roever would be my supervisor.
### 2.4 A Master’s degree in a relevant discipline which includes a substantial research component,
equivalent to at least 25% of one year of full-time study and achieved a minimum weighted average of 75% or (University of Melbourne) equivalent, with a minimum result of 80% for the research component
My weighted average is 83% (in process) and I would conduct a 25-points research module (minor thesis for applied linguistics) under the supervision of Carsten Roever in 2021.
### 2.5 English Language Criteria
I have studied in Melbourne for two year and my IELTS score is 7.5 with the average band of 7.0.
## 3. Socially responsible
### 3.1 A high regard for human rights, social inclusion, ethics and the environment
For my personal experience, I had conducted a research project to help Chinese minority group to protect their cultural heritage, so I believe I’m capable enough to consider human right issues. I also attended a number of subjects concerning human right issues and historical development during my past study, such as Australian History, American History. During this process, I gained a deep understanding in how to interpret events (e.g., feminism issues) under certain social background and the meaning of human right in history.
### 3.2 Ability to work collaboratively with people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds
During my past research experience, I have collaborated with oversea researchers and successfully helped to manage a huge cross-cultural linguistic study as a research assistant. In addition, during my master’s degree, I often helped other members who have diverse cultural and language background in my team to fulfill the group project as a group leader.
