## The world through my window 

‘It is so blue’, when I suddenly raise my head and look outside, the blue sky of Melbourne just surprises me in a minute. Living in Carlton for a quite long time,  I never noticed that the view through my apartment window can be so amazing. The RMIT building is in front of where I live, and I can see quite a lot students walking in and out with their bags and holding their books. The Yarra tram passes by with a sound of bells. Also, there are two birds resting on my balcony, the interesting thing is that my cat Ray, who really has strange fantasy of being a bird, she would imitate the sound of bird every time when she sees the birds through the window.  It is also attractive to spend some time on observing the pedestrian crossing between my apartment building and RMIT building since there are a lot of people passing. I always think that observing others is quite an interesting reflection of my inner thoughts in some degree. Taking a glance further away, I can even see Melbourne Central, although I know it is quite near where I live.  When I look back, one of my cat is staring at me, at that moment, I cannot be more felicific.  

## Reflection on this short piece:

- what there anything you learnt from doing this activity?
- What did you find challenging about it/what easy?
- What sort of language did you use?

## My reflection:

How to arrange the structure of a passage in a short time is the most important thing I learnt through this activity. After listening and reviewing on other’s piece, I realised that in the writing, personal feeling and reflection can also be linked with objective view.

Secondly, it is not a easy task to provide something complete within 20 minutes, the time pressure is also a huge challenge for me to overcome since I’m always a slow typer.

Also, considering this is a piece about daily view and scene, so what I adopt is the language to describe things instead of academic or argumentative overall.
