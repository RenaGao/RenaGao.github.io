## Introduction of opinion piece:

This opinion piece is about the usage of language learning apps on smartphones and their advantages in assisting language learners. It can function as a ‘fun starter’ for new beginners. I often heard a lot of learners complaining about how hard they felt when touching a new language. Regarding my personal experience, it occurs to me that as a linguistics major, I can introduce this way of learning to the general audience helping them to learn. 

This opinion piece expresses the subjective opinion from the author instead of an academic argumentation overall. Compared with the voice of an academic paper, this opinion piece is a different genre needing a more comprehensible style and a credible voice. To draft this opinion piece, I read plenty of articles on The Conversations to familiarize the professional style. 


## Reflection of opinion piece:

- Learning to adopt different genre

The genre of an opinion piece is quite different from an academic paper which I am familiar with. This requires me to transfer my writing style and learn how to suit the voice of different audiences in writing. So, in order to learn the style and language traits of this opinion piece, I almost read about 20 articles on The Conversations and The Guardians. Then I realized the biggest bias for me is to come up with an attractive beginning and ending since for most academic papers the beginning and ending are usually introductions and conclusions without the requirements to entertain or lure the audience to your article. But after drafting this article, I realize one thing is that the good beginning is half of a good piece for the general public. To better achieve this goal, I employ open interrogatives at the beginning of this opinion piece and provide an example related to myself in learning through smartphone apps to echo with the audience who may be interested in learning a language through smartphone apps as well.

- Get rid of previous writing conventions

During my past paper drafting, I would employ a lot of jargon or terms in the Linguistics field. Also, the sentences need to be complex and comprehensive in general. However, for this assignment, the writing conventions are different since the writing purpose and the target audience are all shifted. For example, I tried to divide long and complex sentences into short ones to make the passage more understandable. Also, I put several hyperlinks in the articles to help readers to understand the terms in this article. Hence, to attract reader’s interest, some fun pictures were inserted in the articles to make this passage more attractive.

- Challenges in drafting

To be honest, there were some barriers when I was drafting this article. This topic expects the target readers to have some general background knowledge in second language learning while I try to break the gap between the academic concepts in second language acquisition and the acceptability of the general audience. In general, I wanted to present the necessity of language learning apps in current e-life and two advantages of how they can promote language learning in a spare time and in a leisure way. But the focus needs to be more constant, and the explanation of the key information needs to be more focused due to the 800 words limitation, so I cut several sentences and unnecessary points after finishing the first draft.

- New thoughts after receiving the feedback

Also, some thoughts occur to me after receiving the feedback of this opinion piece as well. For example, more editing is still needed when drafting an opinion piece. Also, even minor typos may cause misunderstanding for the general readers. So proofreading and careful editing is necessary in this kind of writing.
