    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a practice writing piece during the second seminar of Professional Literacies, about the view outside the apartment window. It is required that we need to provide a detailed description of the scene.</p><!-- ![](/images/activity-1-paragraph-image1.jpeg) --><img src="/assets/images/activity-1-paragraph-image1.jpeg" width="286" height="440" /><h2 id="The-world-through-my-window"><a href="#The-world-through-my-window" class="headerlink" title="The world through my window"></a>The world through my window</h2><p>â€˜It is so blueâ€™, when I suddenly raise my head and look outside, the blue sky of Melbourne just surprises me in a minute. Living in Carlton for a quite long time,  I never noticed that the view through my apartment window can be so amazing. The RMIT building is in front of where I live, and I can see quite a lot students walking in and out with their bags and holding their books. The Yarra tram passes by with a sound of bells. Also, there are two birds resting on my balcony, the interesting thing is that my cat Ray, who really has strange fantasy of being a bird, she would imitate the sound of bird every time when she sees the birds through the window.  It is also attractive to spend some time on observing the pedestrian crossing between my apartment building and RMIT building since there are a lot of people passing. I always think that observing others is quite an interesting reflection of my inner thoughts in some degree. Taking a glance further away, I can even see Melbourne Central, although I know it is quite near where I live.  When I look back, one of my cat is staring at me, at that moment, I cannot be more felicific.  </p><h2 id="Reflection-on-this-short-piece"><a href="#Reflection-on-this-short-piece" class="headerlink" title="Reflection on this short piece:"></a>Reflection on this short piece:</h2><ul><li>What there anything you learnt from doing this activity?</li><li>What did you find challenging about it/what easy?</li><li>What sort of language did you use?</li></ul><h2 id="My-reflection"><a href="#My-reflection" class="headerlink" title="My reflection:"></a>My reflection:</h2><p>How to arrange the structure of a passage in a short time is the most important thing I learnt through this activity. After listening and reviewing on otherâ€™s piece, I realised that in the writing, personal feeling and reflection can also be linked with objective view.</p><p>Secondly, it is not a easy task to provide something complete within 20 minutes, the time pressure is also a huge challenge for me to overcome since Iâ€™m always a slow typer.</p><p>Also, considering this is a piece about daily view and scene, so what I adopt is the language to describe things instead of academic or argumentative overall.</p>]]></content>

All four interviewees are Master students from the School of Language and Linguistics. The interview adopts the semi-structured way to see their change and attitude towards the online learning and their social life as well as their future work choice in year 2020.</p><p>During the process of completing this assignment, four members in our group collaborative well although we basically depend on online communicate software to update on each other. Before we actually conducting the interview, I settled the topic and focus of this interview, then all the group members brainstormed on the interview questions collaboratively. Then, each of us is responsible for one part in the report and contacted our interviewees respectively.<br>During the process of each interview, four group members would all be in the Zoom session and after completing the interview, all members would listen to the recording again and find some interesting points to address in the report. Finally, after drafting the report, we improved the ability of collaborative work, especially in writing and conducting interview.</p><h2 id="Reflection-of-the-interview-report"><a href="#Reflection-of-the-interview-report" class="headerlink" title="Reflection of the interview report:"></a>Reflection of the interview report:</h2><ul><li>Identify the interview focus is essential</li></ul><p>Before conducting this assignment, I have interview experience when I was the Research Assistant in the Australian Center. But I mainly help to collect data and analyse discourse data instead of design an interview individually by myself. When first dived into this report, I began to wonder what is worth interviewing for international students in Australian university since I hold such an identity myself. After a reflection on my own experience in the past year, I think to interest the impact of the pandemic on international students would be interesting and meaningful. Thus, I decided to set the topic as:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> How COVID-19 Pandemic Affect Studying Abroad in Australian University: A Case of Master Students in School of Language and Linguistics</p></blockquote><ul><li>Make everyone clear about their role</li></ul><p>To be honest, this is the most challenging part for me since the other three group members donâ€™t have any interview or analysis experience, so it makes all members understanding their role in the first place is quite difficult. So, I use several times to show them the difference between interview and conversation and how to analyse interview discourse from an objective perspective. Besides, we also marked everyoneâ€™s part in a Google Doc so that the whole group could be much clearer about the whole process and progress of the report. Even four group members mainly worked remotely due to the post-pandemic reason, but the weekly meeting went go pretty smooth.</p><ul><li>Time management is everything</li></ul><p>When the group are working on the interview and the report, there are other assignments due at the same time, and after everyone finalized their part, I would look through all the report and correct some typos and grammar mistakes. Thus, it is essential to allocate the duty in a reasonable schedule. Through this assignment, I learned how to collaborate writing and interview others professionally, including all the processes from designing interview questions to finally doing the transcript.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction-on-the-Job-Set"><a href="#Introduction-on-the-Job-Set" class="headerlink" title="Introduction on the Job Set"></a>Introduction on the Job Set</h2><p>This job set is mainly about my personal background and research experience in response to the requirement for PhD selection criteria in the Arts faculty of UniMelb and focuses on highlighting my research interest and advantages in perusing further study in the School and Language and Linguistics.</p><p>The set includes three parts, a Cover letter, CV and selection criteria respectively. The main purpose of the cover letter is to recommend me to the supervisor who is matching with my research interest and show my highlights in academic research and professional experience. The second part (CV) is mainly about detailed information about me, such as past educational background, publications, professional experience, research outcome and skills. Finally, the main focus of the response to selection criteria is to reflect how I meet each selection criteria in perusing for a PhD study in UniMelb. </p><div>    <a href="/assets/files/Wei-Gao-PL-PhD-CV.pdf" download="Wei-Gao-PL-PhD-CV.pdf">Renaâ€™s Job SetðŸ‘‰</a>    <a href="/assets/files/Wei-Gao-PL-PhD-CV.pdf" download="Wei-Gao-PL-PhD-CV.pdf" style="background: #32373c;border-radius: 2em;color: #fff;font-size: 13px;padding: .5em 1em;border: 0;margin-left: .75em;text-decoration: none;transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out 0s;" >Download<a/></div><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Reflection-on-the-Job-Set"><a href="#Reflection-on-the-Job-Set" class="headerlink" title="Reflection on the Job Set"></a>Reflection on the Job Set</h2><ul><li>Challenges in designing this Job Set:</li></ul><p>First of all, the most challenging part in this job set is to suit myself in the requirement of assignment instead of a real PhD application. Since the genre and cover letter in the real selection is quite different with the requirements in this subject in many aspects. For example, in the CV required for a real PhD application, a section of briefly introduce proposed topic is necessary for the selection committee, while in this subject, the CV does not need to include this part. And I struggled with the different requirements a lot when I touch this job set at first.</p><ul><li>Get to work on this Job Set:</li></ul><p>However, after Janneâ€™s advice and her suggestion during the several seminars, I felt much better at understanding the difference of this assignment between the real requirements in PhD application. So, I made several adjustments in drafting this job set. First, I cut several details in my CV, only kept the most relevant experience and highlights in my past research and academic experience. Also, the length of the cover letter was shortened to one page and become more concise in the whole content, and I didnâ€™t include the research purpose which is actually required in the application. Furthermore, for the response to selection criteria, I modified a little bit on the overall structure in order to make it clearer since the requirements of the PhD selection of Arts is quite long and a lot of documents and supplementary materials are needed as well.</p><ul><li>More understanding on this kind of genre:</li></ul><p>After receiving the feedback, I realised that the Job Set has completely different purpose than the academic writing, which is short, appropriate and accurate in general tone, instead of listing much details or presenting deep understanding in certain position.</p><p>Thus, it suits me better in my future resume preparation as well as drafting for cover letter in emails to the target person (e.g. supervisor).</p>]]></content>
